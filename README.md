## Requirements

Let users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Upon user submission the app will display the new entry on the left side of the page.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a button. 
When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Technologies Used

Mysql,
Node.js,
Express + Express Handlebars
Other NPM command line utility + packages

## Functionality

App functionality depends on user input and table data.
The table is printed to the screen.
The user has the option to input a new burger name, or devour an existing one.
A delete button allows the user to delete any burger they don't like from the list.

## Future Development

- Full CSS webpage
